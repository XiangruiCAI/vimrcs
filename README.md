    cd ~
    mkdir .vim
    cd .vim
    git clone https://github.com/XiangruiCAI/vimrcs
    cd vimrcs

NOTE: the users needs install `git bash` on windows (it is usually installed along with `git`). The above commonds can run in `git bash` with out any modification. 

# Shortcuts

Currently, the shortcuts can refer to the ones of [amix](https://github.com/amix/vimrc). I will finish a table of shortcuts soon.

# TODO

- More support for python, especially for data analytics, such as jupyter.
- Support for c++ programming.
- Better README file.
